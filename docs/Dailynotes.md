### Today I Learned

- 1.School works
  1)Data structure : Dynamic Allocated Arrays, Structures and Unions, Self-Referential Structures, Polynomial Representation by C code.

- 2.Codeplus lecture & PS solving(4)

  1)Bitsmaks : when memories are limited and sovling sums
  ex) Boj11723 : making partial unions, Boj1182: getting sum of partial unions.

  2)Dynamic Programming : Using past value to get present value.
  ex) Boj 15988 ,Boj 1699

- 3.Comento bootcampe
  Warning points of coding with C

  a) preprocesser(ex: #define, #inclue<~>/header files, Macro with # define)

  b) Features of const values

  c) Guessing output with pointer inputs

  d) Specific instructions when you coding  
   ex) Avoiding pony values by using #define inputs, Making value name with proper rules,

  e) Memory district of Computer when you compile an run code
  Code(all codes) / Data(global & static variable) / Stack(local variable, parameters) / Heap(malloc function)

### Today I Learned

: I did today other activities, so i didn't do a lot coding, cs, or school work.:worried:

1.  Boj lecture & ps(5 problems)

a) Graph related definitions(very important!!)
: adjacent list, adjacent matrix, basic graph terminology(edge,vertex,conected compents,biparte graph)

b) BFS, DFS & How to make it in code C++ and bloodfill techiques
: BFS(recursion, stack), DFS(queue) // Boj7562

2.  Captone Design 2 specifications and requirements

    : Making web pages with websocket based chat, naver map api, etc.

3.  basic phyton (:to easy to write down)

---

### Tomorrow what i will do.

And I think it would be better if i write down tomorrow to do list to stimulate me.(I will write in google keeps, too)

1)software design lecture(about SW process&development) & HW2 2h.

2)data structure lecture(maybe about sparse matrix) & HW1 2h.

3)Boj lecture upto BFS application & ps(about 10) 3h.

4)nomade coders lecture & mini project 4h.

### Today I Learned

(I didnt write details today, but if i get used to writing TIL I will be better. Now, just focus on writing it everyday continuously.)

1. software design lecture(about SW process&development) & HW2 2h.
   : I reaserched about youtube music architecture & SystemContext Diagram for restructuring.

2. Boj lecture upto BFS application & ps(about 7) + DP 3h.
   : It take more time than i exepected for solving prbrolems :sad:

3. nomade coders lecture & mini project 1h.
   : basic application of html,css,js

---

### Tomorrow what i will do.

1. software design lecture(about SW process&development) & HW2 2h, what i have to do until tomorrow.
2. data structure lecture(maybe about sparse matrix) & HW1 2h
3. And its time to study for Engineer Information Processing, 2h.
4. boj 2nd course & ps(7 - bfs&brute force&dp) 4h
5. etc.

## 10/12

1. 리액트, firebase, jquery, socket.io 등등  새로 배우고 부딪히다보니 모르던 개념이 마구마구 튀어나와서 어렵다.
2. 알고리즘 공부 매일해야하는데, 하루 1문제라도 풀어야지.. 점점 c++ 지원안해주는 곳이 생겨 python이랑 병행해서 풀어야겠다.. ㅠㅠ
3. 여러가지 하루에 나눠서 하려니 못하겠다. 자소서는 하루날잡고 그때만 쓰고, 평소에는 알고리즘, 프로젝트 공부, 학교수업/과제에만 투자하자..
4. 내일도 화이팅!
