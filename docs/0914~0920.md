### Today I Learned

- 1.School works
  1)Data structure : Dynamic Allocated Arrays, Structures and Unions, Self-Referential Structures, Polynomial Representation by C code.

- 2.Codeplus lecture & PS solving(4)

  1)Bitsmaks : when memories are limited and sovling sums
  ex) Boj11723 : making partial unions, Boj1182: getting sum of partial unions.

  2)Dynamic Programming : Using past value to get present value.
  ex) Boj 15988 ,Boj 1699

- 3.Comento bootcampe
  Warning points of coding with C

  a) preprocesser(ex: #define, #inclue<~>/header files, Macro with # define)

  b) Features of const values

  c) Guessing output with pointer inputs

  d) Specific instructions when you coding  
   ex) Avoiding pony values by using #define inputs, Making value name with proper rules,

  e) Memory district of Computer when you compile an run code
  Code(all codes) / Data(global & static variable) / Stack(local variable, parameters) / Heap(malloc function)

### Today I Learned

: I did today other activities, so i didn't do a lot coding, cs, or school work.:worried:

- 1. Boj lecture & ps(5 problems)

  a) Graph related definitions(very important!!)
  : adjacent list, adjacent matrix, basic graph terminology(edge,vertex,conected compents,biparte graph)

  b) BFS, DFS & How to make it in code C++ and bloodfill techiques
  : BFS(recursion, stack), DFS(queue) // Boj7562

- 2. Captone Design 2 specifications and requirements

     : Making web pages with websocket based chat, naver map api, etc.

- 3. basic phyton (:to easy to write down)

### Tomorrow what i will do.

And I think it would be better if i write down tomorrow to do list to stimulate me.(I will write in google keeps, too)

-> 1)software design lecture(about SW process&development) & HW2 2h.

2)data structure lecture(maybe about sparse matrix) & HW1 2h.

3)Boj lecture upto BFS application & ps(about 10) 3h.

4)nomade coders lecture & mini project 4h.

5)etc... Cheer up... :cry:
