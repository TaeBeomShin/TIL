### Today I Learned

- 1.School works
  1)Data structure : Dynamic Allocated Arrays, Structures and Unions, Self-Referential Structures, Polynomial Representation by C code.

- 2.Codeplus lecture & PS solving(4)

  1)Bitsmaks : when memories are limited and sovling sums
  ex) Boj11723 : making partial unions, Boj1182: getting sum of partial unions.

  2)Dynamic Programming : Using past value to get present value.
  ex) Boj 15988 ,Boj 1699

- 3.Comento bootcampe
  Warning points of coding with C
  a) preprocesser(ex: #define, #inclue<~>/header files, Macro with # define)
  b) Features of const values
  c) Guessing output with pointer inputs  
   d) Specific instructions when you coding  
   ex) Avoiding pony values by using #define inputs, Making value name with proper rules,
  e) Memory district of Computer when you compile an run code
  Code(all codes) / Data(global & static variable) / Stack(local variable, parameters) / Heap(malloc function)
